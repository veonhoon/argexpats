OPEN GRAPH IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

The site is configured to use /images/og-image.jpg for social media sharing.

To add your Open Graph image:

1. Create an image with dimensions 1200x630 pixels (recommended by Facebook/Twitter)
2. Save it as "og-image.jpg"
3. Place it in this directory: /static/images/

This image will appear when your site is shared on:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- WhatsApp
- Other social platforms

Tips:
- Use clear, high-contrast text if including text
- Avoid placing important content near edges (may be cropped)
- Keep file size under 1MB for fast loading
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

You can create OG images using:
- Canva: https://www.canva.com/

- Adobe Express: https://www.adobe.com/express/

You can also create per-post OG images by adding to frontmatter:
